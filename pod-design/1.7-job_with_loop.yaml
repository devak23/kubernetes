# The default behavior of a Job is to run the workload in a single Pod and expect one successful completion. Thatâ€™s
# what Kubernetes calls a non-parallel Job. Internally, those parameters are tracked by the attributes
# spec.template.spec.completions and spec.template.spec.parallelism, each with the assigned value 1. The following
# command renders the parameters of the Job we created earlier:
#
# % kubectl get jobs counter -o yaml | grep -C 1 "completions"
#  backoffLimit: 6
#  completions: 1
#  parallelism: 1
#
# The spec.backoffLimit attribute determines the number of retries a Job attempts to successfully complete the workload
# until the executed command finishes with an exit code 0. The Job manifest needs to explicitly declare the restart
# policy by using spec.template.spec.restartPolicy. The default restart policy of a Pod is Always, which tells the
# Kubernetes scheduler to always restart the Pod even if the container exits with a zero exit code
